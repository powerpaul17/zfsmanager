promote_cmd=zfs promote <u>clone-filesystem</u>
promote_desc=Promotes a clone file system to no longer be dependent on its "origin" snapshot. This makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from. The clone parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that the origin file system becomes a clone of the specified file system. <br /><br /> The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are now owned by the promoted clone. The space they use moves from the origin file system to the promoted clone, so enough space must be available to accommodate these snapshots. No new space is consumed by this operation, but the space accounting is adjusted. The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own. The rename subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.

setzfs_cmd=zfs set property=value <u>filesystem|volume|snapshot</u> ...
setzfs_desc=Sets the property to the given value for each dataset. Only some properties can be edited. See the "Properties" section for more information on what properties can be set and acceptable values. Numeric values can be specified as exact values, or in a human-readable form with a suffix of B, K, M, G, T, P, E, Z (for bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, or zettabytes, respectively). User properties can be set on snapshots. For more information, see the "User Properties" section.

clone_cmd=zfs clone [-p] [-o <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>] ... snapshot <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>
clone_desc=Creates a clone of the given snapshot. See the "Clones" section for details. The target dataset can be located anywhere in the ZFS hierarchy, and is created as the same type as the original.<br /><br />-p<br />Creates all the non-existing parent datasets. Datasets created in this manner are automatically mounted according to the mountpoint property inherited from their parent. If the target  filesystem  or  volume  already exists, the operation completes successfully.<br /><br />-o <u>property</u>=<u>value</u><br /> Sets the specified property; see zfs create for details.

export_cmd=zpool export [-a] [-f] <u>pool</u> ...
export_desc=Exports the given pools from the system. All devices are marked as exported, but are still considered in use by other subsystems. The devices can be moved between systems (even those of different endianness) and imported as long as a sufficient number of devices are present.<br /><br />Before exporting the pool, all datasets within the pool are unmounted. A pool can not be exported if it has a shared spare that is currently being used.<br /><br />For pools to be portable, you must give the zpool command whole disks, not just partitions, so that ZFS can label the disks with portable EFI labels. Otherwise, disk drivers on platforms of different endianness will not recognize the disks.<br /><br />-a    Exports all pools imported on the system.<br /><br />-f    Forcefully unmount all datasets, using the "unmount -f" command. <br /><br />This command will forcefully export the pool even if it has a shared spare that is currently being used. This may lead to potential data corruption.<br /><br />
